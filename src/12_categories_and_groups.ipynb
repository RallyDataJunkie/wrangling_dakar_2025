    "This is another area where the *pandas* package comes into its own. But first, let's think through what we need to do. In each row of the table, the `categoryGroupLangs` cell contains a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary has a `variable`, (which by inspection of the dataframe seems to match the `shortLabel` column value in the dataframe); the `locale` specfies a language code, and the `text` is a description of the vehicle type.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we `explode()` the `categoryGroupLangs` column, we can unpack the list in each cell and generate one row for each list item. This produces a `pandas.Series` datatype; each `index` value in the `Series` matches the index value of the parent row in the dataframe that was exploded to form that `Series` row. "
