# Setting Up Your Development Envioronment

This books provides a practical hands on guide to working with data at the code level as well as at an "application" level.

If you want to gain experience of working with data at the code level, you'll need access to some sort of development environment. For working at the application level, all the applications introduced in this guide can be found online, although you can also run them locally if you prefer.
